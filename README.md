# My-First-Project
Here are my HyperionDev projects that i'll be creating, updating and improving as my python skills also update and improve!

Cafe.py - 23/12/23 - Each menu option has full functionality with defensive programming put in place.
						There maybe some options that don't have full defences in place but will be updated soon. 
						Also, I want to look at making the program look as good as it can and be pleasing to read through
						for the user.
